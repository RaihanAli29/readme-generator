## Description
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it's important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include the app's purpose, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. This last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

## Technologies
* VS Code
* GitBash
* Node.js

## Usage
1. Git clone this GitHub repository.
2. Install NPM (Node Package Manager) by the following code: "npm init -y".
3. Install the Inquirer package by the following code: "npm install inquirer". This command installs the Inquirer package, which is a popular package for creating interactive command-line interfaces.
4. Initialize prompts using the command "node index.js".
5. From there, answer the questions and Voila! You have successfully generated a new README file for your project. This file can now be used to provide important information about your project to users and contributors.
